Databases are efficient ways of storing and managing data. Databases store organised or structured data using relational model which stores data in two dimensional format like tables, represented in rows and columns

Each row in a table represents a single record with unique ID called Key. A record is a meaningful and consistent way of combining information about something.  
A column represents a field of attribute or an item of information. 

Relational database management systems also known as RDBMS are softwares used to create and manage databases.

Structured Query Language also called SQL is the Language used to talk to databases. Functions like Create, Read, Update and Delete are some of the basic functions in perfomed in a Relational Database Management System.

Data in a database could be consumed by applications ( e.g Reporting Application like Power BI) or directly queried by people

Examples of relational database management system are: Microsoft sql server, mySql, etc..

## Databsase Design üñåÔ∏è

This is the process of organizing and classifying data and indentifying relationships with a view to producing a detailed data model of the database. 

**A good Database design ensures the following:**

 ‚úîÔ∏è No duplicate information or duplication is kept very minimal. 
 
      Duplicate data also called redundant data is bad. It wastes spaces and increases the posibility of  errors

‚úÖ Information is divided into subject areas.

      Example subject areas are: Product, Customer. This will help to reduce data redundancy

‚úÖ Accomodate data processing and reporting needs 

‚úÖ Ensure correctness and completeness of information. 

   If your Database does not contain correct information, 
   the results is that any report that pulls information from it will also be incorrect
  
##  Design Process

üìò Determine the purpose of your Database.

     ‚úîÔ∏è This is how you intend to use the database. You could elicit requirement or conduct similar exercise
      to determine its use. Example: a Customer database that keeps a list of customer related information.

üìò Gather and organize all forms of information required

      ‚úîÔ∏è After you have determined the purpose of your database, you need to gather data needed to be
      stored on the database. Consider reporting requirements, user requirements etc.. and what other information
      you will need to satisfy these

üìò Divide information into tables

      ‚úîÔ∏è Divide data into subject based tables. Choose major entities for subjects


üìò Specify primary keys - Choose a column or several columns to uniquly identify each rows
  
    ‚úîÔ∏è Primary Keys:
    
         Each table should have a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row. This is called the Primary
         Key. For example on a 'Customer Table', a good primary key will be the Customer Id rather than the Customer Name, 
         as several other customers can have same names. You could also use arbitrary unique number or an autogenerated 
         unique numbers as Primary Keys. Primary Keys cannot have duplicate values.
    
         A Primary Key must have a value. If when selecting your primary key, there is a possibility of the key to have an
         unknown or unassigned value, this cannot be used as a Primary Key. 
    
         The Primary Key value should not change. This is because within a relational database, tables can reference other
         tables via their Primary Keys and if the primary key changes, you will have to update all the Primary keys on the
         tables being referenced. If a Primary Key changes, it can increase the risk of primary keys being out of synch with 
         tables referencing it.
    
         In summary, 
         A primary key cannot be NULL. 
         A primary key value must be unique. 
         A primary key value should rarely change. 
         A primary key must be given a value one a new record is inserted
    
    ‚úîÔ∏è Composite keys : 
    
         These are primary keys comprising multiple columns used to identify a record uniquely

üìò Set up table relationships

    By creating relationships between the tables, we can bring varying information together in meaningful ways.
    The different relationships are detailed below:
    
    ‚úîÔ∏è One - to - Many
            This speaks about a parent record in a table having reference to zero or more records in the child table
            Example of this can be found in a "Company Database" where a Manager on the 'Managers Table' can manage zero or
            multiple Employees on the 'Employee Table'
        
    ‚úîÔ∏è One - to - One
            This is when Tables have a single relationships with each other. For example a 'Product Table' having productID as its 
            Primary Key will have a one to one relationship to a Product suplement table called 'Product Details Table'
            
    ‚úîÔ∏è Many - to - Many
            This speaks about two tables with multiple references to each other. Example: on a "Product Order" Database, 
            An 'Order Table' can have single order with more than one product on the 'Product Table' and also a single Product
            on the 'Product Table'can appear on many orders on the 'Orders Table'
        

üìò Apply Normalisation rules

   Normalisation is a process of efficiently organising data in a database to eliminate redundancy and inconsistent dependencies. 
   This includes creating Tables and establishing relationmships between these tables.
   
   The rules for database Normalisations are called 'Normal Forms'. 
   
   If a database conforms to the first normal form, then the database is said to be in the first normal form
   If it adheres to the first three normal forms, the database is considered to be in the third normal form.
   
   There are about 5 Normal forms, but only the first three are considered to be the highest level necessary for most applications. 
   
    ‚úîÔ∏è First normal form (1NF)
            - Each cell should contain a single value. 
               We need to eliminate repeating groups of columns in a cell (e.g. item1, item2, ..)
            - Creation of separate tables for related data
            - Identify each set of related data with a primary key
            
            
    ‚úîÔ∏è Second normal form (2NF)
         - The table is already in 1NF
         - Every non-key column is fully dependent on the primary key (or composite key)
               E.g, An 'OrderDetails' table having primary key comprising 'ProductID' and 'OrderId'. If unit_price is only
               dependent on 'ProductID' it should not be kept in 'OrderDetails' Table but the 'Product' table. On the other
               hand. If unit_price is also dependent on the particular Order. It can be kept in 'OrderDetails' table
         - Create separate table for sets of values that apply to multiple records. 
               E.g, Customer Address can be stored on Customer Address table intstead of multiple tables that use it 
               like Orders, Shipping, Invoicing tables
         - Relate these tables using a Foreign key
         
     ‚úîÔ∏è Third normal form (3NF)
         - The table is already in 2NF
         - Eliminate field that do not depend on the key. Columns should not depend on each other but only the primary key
               E.g, on a 'Product' table with 'ProductID' as primary key. Discount_rate should not belong to 'Product' table
               if it depends on unit_price on the same table.
         - Note: Whilst 3NF is desirable, it might not always be practical. creation of separate smaller tables to remove 
               inter-column relationships in some instances might degrade performance. Ensure you are fully aware of your
               design decisions and document it
  


## Un Structured or Semi Structured Databases
It could also describe storage of non structured or Document data in NoSql  Databases like Mongo DB.
