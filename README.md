## Relational Databases :computer:

This desribes a databse that stores organised or structured data in a Database also known as Relational Database Management Systems or RDBMS. Examples of such Databases are mySQL, MS SQL Server, PostgreSQL, e.t.c.. 

RDBMS is based on relational model which stores data in two dimensional format where tables of data are represented in rows and columns. Each row in a table represents a single record with unique ID called Key. A column represents a field of attribute or an item of information. A record therefore is a meaningful and consistent way of combining information about something. 

Functions like Create, Read, Update and Delete are some of the basic functions in perfomed by RDBMS

## Databsase Design 🖌️

A good Database design ensures the following:

💡 Duplicate information is minimal. Duplicate data also called redundant data is bad. This is because it wastes spaces and increases the posibility of  
   errors

💡 Divide information into subject areas to reduce redundancy (e.g, Product, Customer)

💡 Accomodate data processing and reporting needs 

💡 Ensure correctness and completeness of information. If your Database does not contain correct information, the results is that any report that pulls  

  information from it will also be incorrect
  
##  Design Process

💡 Determine the purpose of your Database, either via requirement analysis or similar exercise.

💡 Gather and organize all forms of information required

💡 Divide information into tables

💡 Specify Primary Keys
  
    Each table should have a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row. This is called the Primary Key.
    For example on a 'Customer Table', a good primary key will be the Customer Id rather than the Customer Name, as several 
    other customers can have same names.You could also use arbitrary unique number or an autogenerated unique numbers as 
    Primary Keys. Primary Keys cannot have duplicate values.
    
    A Primary Key must have a value. If in selecting your primary key, there is a possibility of the key to have an unknown  
    or unassigned value, this cannot be used as a Primary Key. 
    
    The Primary Key value should not change. This is because within a relational database, tables can reference other tables 
    via their Primary Keys and if the primary key changes, you will have to update all the Primary keys on the tables being 
    referenced. If a Primary Key changes, it can increase the risk of primary keys being out of synch with tables referencing it.

💡 Set up Table relationships

    By creating relationships between the tables, we can bring varying information together in meaningful ways.
    The different relationships are detailed below:
    
    🟢 One - to - Many
            This speaks about a parent record in a table having reference to zero or more records in the child table
            Example of this can be found in a "Company Database" where a Manager on the 'Managers Table' can manage zero or
            multiple Employees on the 'Employee Table'
        
     🟢 One - to - One
            This is when Tables have a single relationships with each other. For example a 'Product Table' having productID as its 
            Primary Key will have a one to one relationship to a Product suplement table called 'Product Details Table'
            
     🟢 Many - to - Many
            This speaks about two tables with multiple references to each other. Example: on a "Product Order" Database, 
            An 'Order Table' can have single order with more than one product on the 'Product Table' and also a single Product
            on the 'Product Table'can appear on many orders on the 'Orders Table'
        

💡 Apply Normalisation rules

  


## Un Structured or Semi Structured Databases
It could also describe storage of non structured or Document data in NoSql  Databases like Mongo DB.








To create anchor links that jump down to different sections of a README (as in an interactive table of contents), first create a heading:
#Real Cool Heading

The anchor link for that heading is the lowercase heading name with dashes where there are spaces. You can always get the anchor name by visiting the README on Github.com and clicking on the anchor that appears when you hover to the left of the heading. Copy everything starting at the #:
#real-cool-heading

Wherever you want to link to your Real Cool Heading section, put your desired text in brackets, followed by the anchor link in parentheses:
[Go to Real Cool Heading section](#real-cool-heading)

See! Easy: Go to Real Cool Heading section

This is a real cool heading with some real cool content.
